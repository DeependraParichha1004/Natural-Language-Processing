Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. There are many different methods in NLP to understand human language which include statistical and machine learning methods. These involve breaking down human language into its most basic pieces and then understand how these pieces relate to each other and work together to create meanings in sentences.

Applications of Natural Language Processing
1. Chatbots.
2. Autocomplete in Search Enginesggest the most common possibilities. They use Natural Language Processing to make sense of these words and how they are interconnected to form different sentences.
3. Voice Assistants
4. Language Translator and basic vocabulary of the language
5. Sentiment Analysis
6. Grammar Checkers 
7. Email Classification and Filtering
